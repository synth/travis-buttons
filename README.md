Travis Buttons

Better buttons for TravisCI

Yoeman app

Install Yoeman, bower, npm.

Install jquery and handlebars via bower.

Load in app directory into chrome as a chrome extension.

Every change requires a reload in the chrome extension.

At the moment, I'm not sure if I was suppose to check in what I checked in. What I read is the node_modules are cool and the bower_components have gitignore.
